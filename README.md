# LaserAmmoCompetitiveShooterProStages

Repo v2024.04.06

Repo to share the Laser Ammo Competitive Shooter Pro Stages that I have Created To Share with the public

This will contain stages from USPSA and IDPA from misc matches that I have shot or from the match book before a major match or just stages that are made up.  Maybe even some action steel like stages

Just Click on Code and Download to download all the stages from this repo and then you can pick and choose which stages you want to install locally on your machine.

This is just a starter repo, i'm sure as more stages come about I will be changing the format of the file structure, But things will be listed in the documentation.
